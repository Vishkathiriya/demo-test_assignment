# Scroll Glow Removal
The MyBehavior class is a custom scroll behavior in Flutter that removes the scroll glow effect when overscrolling.

# Usage
To use the MyBehavior class, follow these steps:

1.Import the necessary package in your Dart file:
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

2.Apply the MyBehavior to the desired scrollable widget:
ScrollConfiguration(
  behavior: MyBehavior(),
  child: ListView(
    // Your scrollable content
  ),
)
This will remove the scroll glow effect when the ListView is overscrolled.

# Example
Here's an example of how you can use the MyBehavior class:

class MyScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: Text('Scroll Glow Removal'),
      ),
      body: ScrollConfiguration(
        behavior: MyBehavior(),
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            // Your scrollable content
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

Feel free to customize the MyBehavior class or apply it to different scrollable widgets in your application.
